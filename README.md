# PROF X
Professor X lets you manipulate math equations using your mouse, to do algebra transformations.  
By playing with these equations, you will gain a basic understanding of algebric rules.

## Functionality
1. Select  
Click and Drag your mouse to create a selection box. Math variables under the box will be selected.  
  
2. Move variables
After selecting a variable like x, click on the pointer on the top to move the variable  
  
[x] + y = 3 

to 

y + [x] = 3  
  
The app will take care of sign changes.

3. Fraction
Move x over the equation  
[x] / y =  z  
to  
1 / y = z / [x]

4. Bracket Multiplication
[x] (a + b) = 4
to  
[x]a + [x]b = 4
